# Hello-from-Ubuntu
I'd like to use Ubuntu to create shell version of Hello World.
I just joined hackforla website's dev team and am looking forward to contributing my current skills and building many more.
So far, it's been very interesting.  
Earlier today, I hosted a web page on git-hub pages at: https://robertafricker.github.io/Hello-World/.  
I'm looking forward to getting a web page up that's coded from Ubuntu.  
Let's see how it goes!
